# Chat AI

## Overview

**Chat AI** is a simple ChatGPT-like application that uses a custom LLM model named **GPT-4o-mini**. This is a *
*full-stack** project built with **Laravel**, **Breeze**, **Vue.js**, **Inertia**, **Tailwind CSS**, and uses **SQLite**
for local data storage.

Below are the instructions to install and run the application in your local environment.

---

## Prerequisites

1. **PHP** (tested on version 8.0.30)
2. **Composer**
3. **Node.js** & **NPM** (for running the front-end build)
4. **Mailpit** (or another local mail testing tool)

> **Note**:
> - SQLite is the default database for this project; no additional DB setup is necessary.
> - If you prefer a different database, update your `.env` accordingly (not covered here).

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Ensure you have the project files in a local directory.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   ```bash
   cd chat-ai
    ``` 
3. **Install PHP Dependencies**
   ```bash
   composer install
    ```
4. **Install JavaScript Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
    ``` 
5. **Environment Configuration**

    - Copy the example environment file:
       ```bash
       cp .env.example .env
      ```
    - Adjust any necessary variables in the `.end` file (e.g., app name, mail settings, etc.).

6. **Generate Application Key**

   Create a unique application key for encryption and security:

   ```bash
   php artisan key:generate
   ```
7. **Database Setup**

   Create the database in your DBMS, then run migrations to set up the necessary tables:

   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```
7. **OpenAI API key to chat with an AI**

   Place your OpenAI API key in the .env file

   ```bash
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...
   ```

> **Note**: By default, SQLite is configured in `config/database`.phpâ€”you typically only need to ensure
`DB_CONNECTION=sqlite` in your `.end` if you wish to use SQLite.
